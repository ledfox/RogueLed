Goblin PlagueBug Version

In this version, the first goblin to die inexplicably kills the other goblins in the area. Could be spun as "Other Goblings Flee," but for right now this is being treated as a bug.

BENEFITS:
Win con active

DRAWBACKS:
Rage isn't working at the moment. May simply need to toss more goblins in.
